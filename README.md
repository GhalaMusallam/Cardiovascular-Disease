# Cardiovascular-Disease

## Project Information
- **Students**: Aljazzi Alhassan, Ghala Musallam, Reuof Alanazi, Modi Albassam, Maha Albakr
- **Motivation**: We chose the cardiovascular disease dataset because these diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. The dataset helps us create models for early detection, which could save lives. It includes important factors like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, smoking, and alcohol intake, making it valuable for analysis. Insights from this data could help healthcare providers in early detection and personalized treatment planning. By focusing on this dataset, we're dealing with classification and clustering.
